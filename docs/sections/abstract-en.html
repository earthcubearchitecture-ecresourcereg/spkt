<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Technical Specifiations Controlled Vocabulary was created for NSF's EarthCube Program's Resource Repository.  At this point it merely lists the types of specifications used by these resources.  It is anticipated that this vocabulary will be extended over time as resources are added to the registry.  If you have suggestions or wish to help in extending via new terms, axioms, or annotations please see https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-ecresourcereg.</span>
